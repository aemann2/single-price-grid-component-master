Had no problem with this one. I decided to do a true mobile-first design, and I like the way it worked out. After watching Kevin Powell, I decided to start with the mobile styling, and wrote a single `media query` for a medium-sized screen using `min-width`. Since `grid` is naturally responsive, it worked out very well. Also, Wes Bos's grid course paid off! I now feel comfortable using grid.
